# Coordinate-and-Vector-converter
This is a small app for converting between cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates. It also converts between vectors written in terms of cartesian, cylindrical and spherical unit vectors. It's built using MatLab app designer.

# How to use the app:

## 1. Choose the mode:
   - If you want to convert from a **coordinate system** to another (e.g.: From cartesian: (3, 4, 5) to cylindrical (5, 53.130 deg, 5)), choose the **coordinate** option.
   - If you want to convert a vector from a **unit vector representation** to another, choose the **Vector** option.
## 2. If the mode is **vector**:

   - Make sure you enter the angle the vector makes with the z-axis (θ) and x-axis (Φ). You only need to do this when converting from cylindrical or spherical unit vector representation to other unit vector representations. This is because cylindrical and spherical unit vectors vary with the angles Φ and θ which they make with the z- and x-axes.
   
     This is not the case for cartesian unit vectors.  
## 3. Click the convert button:
   - E.g.: If you want to convert from cylindrical coordinates to the other coordinate systems, enter the coordinates in the textboxes of the cylindrical coordinates, then click "convert ρΦZ" to convert this coordinate to the other coordinate systems.
